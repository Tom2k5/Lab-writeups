archive.academy.htb
test.academy.htb

```

2. Before you run your page fuzzing scan, you should first run an extension fuzzing scan. What are the different extensions accepted by the domains?
```
ffuf -w domain.txt:W1,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:W2 -u http://W1:40268/indexW2
```

```
academy.htb -> php, phps
test.academy.htb -> php, phps
faculty.academy.htb -> php, php7, phps
archive.academy.htb -> php, phps
```

3. One of the pages you will identify should say 'You don't have access!'. What is the full page URL?
